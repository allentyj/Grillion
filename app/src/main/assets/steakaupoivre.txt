INGREDIENTS

Black peppercorns, crushed
2 filet mignons
Kosher salt
1 pound baby carrots
2 sticks and 2 Tbsp butter, divided
½ cup bourbon
¼ cup orange juice
2-3 Tbsp brown sugar
Thyme
Black pepper
1 pound peas
1 shallot
2 Tbsp mint
Zest of 1 lemon
Vegetable oil
⅓ cup cognac
½ cup beef stock
½ cup heavy cream


Method

Start by crushing your black peppercorns and then straining them through a fine mesh sieve. Pour what’s in the sieve into a bowl and set aside.

Season both sides of your filet mignons heavily with salt and then let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes up to an hour.

In a deep saute pan melt 1 stick of butter. Once it’s bubbly, add your carrots. Slow cook them in the butter for 10-15 minutes, stirring constantly. Add ½ cup of bourbon and once the alcohol has cooked out add ¼ cup of orange juice along with 2-3 Tbsp of brown sugar. Cook until a syrupy glaze has formed. Season with some freshly chopped thyme along with salt and pepper. 

Par-boil the peas for about 2 minutes and then immediately put them in an ice bath (unless they are frozen peas, in which case you can skip that step). Strain the peas. Melt ½ a stick of butter in a pan and then add 1 chopped shallot. Saute for 2 minutes and then add peas. When peas are tender add 2 Tbsp of chopped mint, and the zest of one lemon. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.

Pat the steaks dry and then add them to a hot skillet with vegetable oil. Pan sear the steaks for about 4 minutes per side over a medium high heat. Add ½ a stick of butter and baste the steaks until they reach your desired internal temperature. Set aside and let rest for 10 minutes.

Wipe out the pan and then add your crushed peppercorns. Toast for about 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and add ½ a cup of cognac. Once the alcohol has cooked out, add ½ cup beef stock (before using, boil down 1 cup of beef stock to ½ a cup of beef stock) along with ½ cup of heavy cream. Whisk to combine. Keep stirring and simmering until it thickens up and then add 2 Tbsp of butter. Mix to combine.

Add steak, peas, and carrots to a plate. Top steak with sauce, serve and enjoy!
