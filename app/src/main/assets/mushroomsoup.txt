INGREDIENTS

3 ounces dried porcini mushrooms
48 ounces homemade chicken stock
3/4 cup olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling
2 pounds assorted fresh wild mushrooms, chopped
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme
3 cloves garlic, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped

1/2 cup crème fraîche



Method
Makes 8 servings

Place porcini mushrooms in a metal bowl.  Bring 32 ounces of chicken stock to a boil, and pour over mushrooms, setting aside to steep for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a large stock pot, heat 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat, adding fresh mushrooms once shimmering. Cook until the mushrooms are soft and well-browned, about 10 minutes, and set aside. Add another 1/4 cup olive oil to the same pot, and sauté garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add celery and onions, sautéing over medium heat for 7-10 minutes, or until a dark fond forms on the bottom of the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high, and deglaze pot with sherry, scraping fond off the bottom. Add fresh parsley, thyme, and soaked porcini mushrooms, and simmer for 30 minutes, diluting with remaining chicken stock (or more if desired) if mushrooms are too strong.

Pour soup into the jar of a high-powered blender, and season with salt and pepper.  Blend until nearly smooth, stop the blender, and add torn bread pieces.  Turn the blender on high, and while running, stream remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in through the top, until soup is creamy and emulsified.

In 4 warm, shallow soup bowls, pile a handful of wild mushrooms in the center of each bowl.  Pour soup around the mushrooms, until soup comes halfway up their side.  Grate lemon zest over top, sprinkle with a bit of chopped fresh parsley, and drizzle with olive oil and crème fraîche.
